## Overview

This is my solution to the Product preview card component challenge. It is a simple card
that shows the image of the product and a description with the price and a
button to add to cart.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Svelte + Vite

### What I learned

I have learned on this project that we need to practice everyday and work hard
to really understand how everything works, specially with the images background.
I will have to review this topic better.

```css
.product-card__button {
  width: 100%;
  height: 4.8rem;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 0.8rem;
  background: var(--pri-cyan);
  color: var(--neut-white);
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 1.161rem;
  transition: all 0.3s ease;
}
```

### Continued development

For future development, I will continue to use background-image for divs so I
could practice more the placement of the image in the element.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-TRICKS - Centering CSS Complete Guide](https://css-tricks.com/centering-css-complete-guide/) - If you have two or more block-level elements that need to be centered horizontally in a row, chances are you’d be better served making them a different display type. Here’s an example of making them inline-block and an example of flexbox....

## Acknowledgments

The code may not be perfect compared to my sensei @jonasschmedtman but I need
to thank him because he has shown me the ropes and now I am a confident web
designer.
